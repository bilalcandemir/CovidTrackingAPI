# CovidTrackingAPI
Hello Everyone, I am sharing my Graduation project with you.

First of all, I should start with what this project is.
This project is about Online Corona Virus Test. This project was made for people can make Corona tests and also share them with Doctors in real time.
This application also can calculate the distance between people who are made a test and show the danger zone.

After all of these we can start with Back-End tech stack and also what I've done.

Back-End Tech stack and libraries;

-Database: PostgreSQL

-Services (API): NodeJS

-Create Database and Schemas: Knex (This library allows writing SQL scripts in NodeJS and also allows create database, table etc.)

If you want to see database schemas you should look at the Migration file.

-All services in the API folder.


After Back-End tech stack we can look what I've done in the mobile application state.

I did only an IOS Application with writing Swift on XCode Platform.You can also look and download IOS Project. If you want to look the IOS Project you can visit my repos and click the CovidTrackingApp.
